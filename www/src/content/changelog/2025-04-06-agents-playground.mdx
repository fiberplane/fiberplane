We're excited to launch the Fiberplane Playground for Cloudflare Agents â€”  build, test, and debug AI agents running on Workers and Durable Objects. The playground offers real-time monitoring, detailed introspection of agent state, and full visibility into events like HTTP, WebSocket, and tool calls, making debugging stateful agents faster and more intuitive. Start with the [library here](https://github.com/fiberplane/fiberplane/tree/main/packages/agents).

Read the [announcement blog post here](/blog/cloudflare-agents-playground).

### Features

- State Introspection: Monitor the internal state of your agents
- Message Tracking: View incoming and outgoing messages between agents
- Instance Monitoring: Track each instance of your agents
- Database Inspection: View the state of underlying SQLite database used by the agent

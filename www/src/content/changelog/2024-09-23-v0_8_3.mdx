### Features

- **Improved AI/Timeline/Logs panel** The panels are now combined into a single panel with tabs for each. This makes it easier to switch between them and reduces the amount of space they take up in the UI.

- **Improved logs panel.** The logs icon in the bottom-right corner shows a red dot when there are error-level logs recorded. The panel itself is now more responsive, readable, and features a button for quickly copying the message to clipboard.

- **Empty states.** Sometimes, you don't have the data. Sometimes it's intended and sometimes it's not. This release adds makes the uninteded cases easier to resolve with clear feedback and guidance directly shown in the UI.

### Bug fixes

- **Initial size routes panel**. Fixed an issue where routes panel would be rendered too big when the app was first loaded.

- **Panel resizing issue**. If multiple panels were open, sometimes resizing would not work correctly.

- **Logs panel toggle**. Fixed an issue where the red dot when there are errors would not be displayed.

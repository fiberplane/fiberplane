### Features

- **Improved logs panel.** The logs panel now shows up automatically when there are error-level logs recorded (the logs icon in the bottom-right corner also shows a red dot). The panel itself is now more responsive, readable, and features a button for quickly copying the message to clipboard.

- **Empty states.** Sometimes, you don't have the data. Sometimes it's intended and sometimes it's not. This release adds makes the uninteded cases easier to resolve with clear feedback and guidance directly shown in the UI.

### Features
* Improved code analysis. Through the new @fiberplane/source-analysis package a more flexbile and thorough source code implementation is included
* OpenAPI integration. You can now fetch the OpenAPI spec for your api, and Studio will use it to map spec definitions to your api routes. Expected query parameters, headers, and body fields are then surfaced in Studio.

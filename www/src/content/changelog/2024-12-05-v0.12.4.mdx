### Features
* OpenAPI integration. You can now fetch the OpenAPI spec for your api, and Studio will use it to map spec definitions to your api routes. Expected query parameters, headers, and body fields are then surfaced in Studio.
* Basic Command bar. You can now toggle the timeline or logs with the command bar (`cmd+k`), as well as switch between different tabs (Body, Headers, Params, Docs) in the request fields.
* Natural language request generation. You can now generate requests with an instruction prompt. Press `cmd+shift+g` to open the prompt input.

### Bug fixes
* Added a tooltip to the sidebar panel toggle to make it clearer what the keyboard shortcut is (`cmd+b`)
* Fixed an issue where the route side bar would not highlight the currently selected route after you switched the method manually

### Features

- **Panels**. We have reworked the layouts so that the panels can be shown/hidden independently. The request-response panel is now the default and shapes up the core of the workflow. The timeline and AI-assistant panels can be toggled and shown independently. This will enable you to focus on whichever pieces are currently most important in your workflow.
- **Logs**. Logs have always been available in the timeline view, however, we found them sometimes difficult to parse along with the rest of the information. This new panel will make it easier for you to see _just_ the parts of your request-response lifecycle that you `console.log`-ed.

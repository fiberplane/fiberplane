### Features

- **Sidebar navigation**. The sidebar has been reworked to be fully navigable by keyboard. You can now use the <kbd>j</kbd> and <kbd>k</kbd> keys to navigate the items in the sidebar, toggle the visibility of the sidebar using <kbd>cmd</kbd>/<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>b</kbd>, focus and search with <kbd>/</kbd>, and more.
- **Layout**. The layout of the Studio has been improved to make it denser but also easier to navigate. Each of the panels are adjustable and can be toggled shown or hidden independently. The top bar has been removed in favor of a bottom bar that contains the icons for showing the panels as well as the settings screen.

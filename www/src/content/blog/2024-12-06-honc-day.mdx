It's HONC Day 2k24!

Today we're excited to announce several new features and tools that make building with HONC even better.
Let's take a gander at what's new.

## Introducing Hatch: AI-Powered HONC App Generation

If you're feeling adventurous, you can now let AI generate a HONC app for you, according to a short description.

Just add the `--hatch` flag to the `create-honc-app` command:

```shell
npm create honc-app@latest -- --hatch
```

And you'll be prompted to describe what you want to build:

<Image
  width={400}
  src={hatchExample}
  alt="Create honc app with a 'hatch' prompt"
  style="border-radius: 10px;"
/>

After that, you go through the normal `create-honc-app` flow,
and your template files will be modified to scaffold an api according to your description.

## Adding Client-Side Interactivity to Your HONC Apps

Fiberplane's Oscar van Zijverden put together a guide on client-side hydration for Hono apps, which shows how to add components that go beyond the basic SSR functionality of `hono/jsx`.

This one's worthy of its own separate post on the blog! Check it out here:

## Placegoose: A Goosier Take on JSON Placeholder

Sometimes **you just need some honkin' data**, and that's where [placegoose](https://placegoose.fp.dev/) comes in. It's like JSON Placeholder, but with geese.

The code is open source, and it demonstrates some advanced patterns for building an api with Hono/HONC.
Placegoose is a great reference for modeling more complex data relationships with Drizzle, separating out resources into different routers, and
implementing request validation with centralized error handling.

## Drizzle Seed Support in create-honc-app

A few short weeks ago, [Drizzle announced support](https://x.com/DrizzleORM/status/1859932421514576210) for seeding databases with fake data.
Today, we've integrated that support into `create-honc-app`.

Say goodbye to our hackadoo seed scripts that always yielded the same 3 elements in your database in the HONC templates, and hello to the power of Drizzle's `seed` command. It uses a pseudorandom number generator and their dataset to use consistent but diverse fake data, which is a fancy word for "same same but different" - you can read more about `drizzle-seed` [in their documentation](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/seed-overview#drizzle-seed).

## What's Next?

You tell us! Did anything from this barrage of new HONC launches catch your eye?

Hop in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cqdY6SpfVR) and let us know what you want to see next.

A few things on our radar:

- SSR components for `hono/jsx` ([already in the works](https://github.com/fiberplane/create-honc-app/tree/9b14422df4907acc2b7a90171f38f122ff58d113/ascuii))
- A Web UI to generate new HONC apps with AI
- Guides to writing external APIs with Hono/HONC

## That's a wrap

HONC Day 2k24 is in the books! This is our capstone for Mega Launch Week.

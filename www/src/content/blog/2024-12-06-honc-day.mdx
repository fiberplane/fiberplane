It's HONC Day 2k24! 

Today we're excited to announce several new features and tools that make building with HONC even better.
Let's take a gander at what's new.

## Introducing Hatch: AI-Powered HONC App Generation

If you're feeling adventurous, you can now let AI generate a HONC app for you, according to a short description.

Just add the `--hatch` flag to the `create-honc-app` command:

```shell
npm create honc-app@latest -- --hatch
```

And you'll be prompted to describe what you want to build:

<Image
  width={400}
  src={hatchExample}
  alt="Create honc app with a 'hatch' prompt"
  style="border-radius: 10px;"
/>

After that, you go through the normal `create-honc-app` flow, 
and your template files will be modified to scaffold an api according to your description.

## Adding Client-Side Interactivity to Your HONC Apps

Fiberplane's Oscar van Zijverden put together a guide on client-side hydration for Hono apps, which shows how to add components that go beyond the basic SSR functionality of `hono/jsx`.

This one's worthy of its own separate post on the blog! Check it out here:

## Placegoose: A Goosier Take on JSON Placeholder

Sometimes **you just need some honkin' data**, and that's where [placegoose](https://placegoose.fp.dev/) comes in. It's like JSON Placeholder, but with geese.

The code is open source, and it demonstrates some advanced patterns for building an api with Hono/HONC.
Placegoose is a great reference for modeling more complex data relationships with Drizzle, separating out resources into different routers, and 
implementing request validation with centralized error handling.

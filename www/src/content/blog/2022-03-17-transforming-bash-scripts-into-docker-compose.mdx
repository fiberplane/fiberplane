Fiberplane started out with developers using a mix of Linux and MacOS where bash scripts work perfectly fine for getting a local dev environment running. As the team grew, one of those awkward Windows developers (me, the author) joined and had to deal with a conglomerate of bash scripts without rocking the boat too much by changing the existing process.

Fortunately for me, the bash scripts were just a series of Docker commands and a bit of bash magic that fairly trivially could be converted to Docker Compose.

Here’s a short overview for Windows developers of how I did that: Our backend service relies on two services being available, postgres and AWS S3. For testing object storage while developing locally we use [MinIO](https://min.io/) which provides us with an S3 compatible object storage to test against.

As such the run_all_services.sh bash script serves as the entry point that crates the docker network, starts postgres, then MinIO and awaits ctrl+c to shutdown the whole shebang.

This ends up looking something like this:

```
# This will start all the services required for tests or running the service.
# All services will have their output prefixed with the name of the service.

SCRIPT_DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" &> /dev/null && pwd )"

prefix_cmd() {
    local PREF="${1//\//\\/}" # replace / with \/
    shift
    local CMD=("$@")
    "${CMD[@]}" 1> >(sed "s/^/${PREF}/") 2> >(sed "s/^/${PREF}/" 1>&2)
}

ctrl_c() {
    echo "===> Shutting down services"

    echo "===> Shutting down postgresql"
    kill "$postgresql_pid"

    echo "===> Shutting down minio"
    kill "$minio_pid"
}

echo "===> Creating docker network"
docker network create fiberplane-api

echo "===> Starting postgresql"
prefix_cmd "postgresql: " "$SCRIPT_DIR/run_postgresql.sh" &
postgresql_pid=$!

echo "===> Starting minio"
prefix_cmd "minio: " "$SCRIPT_DIR/run_minio.sh" &
minio_pid=$!

trap ctrl_c INT

wait $postgresql_pid $minio_pid

echo "===> All services stopped"
```

The keen-eyed reader might notice this runs another two bash scripts concurrently which each respectively start postgres/MinIO.

The MinIO bash script looks like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

SCRIPT_DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" &> /dev/null && pwd )"

docker run -t --rm \
    --name minio \
    --network fiberplane-api \
    -v "$SCRIPT_DIR/minio_storage:/data" \
    -p 9000:9000 \
    -p 9001:9001 \
    minio/minio:latest server /data \
        --address=":9000" \
        --console-address=":9001"
```

This is simple to translate into a `docker-compose.yml`. So, let’s do just that:

```yaml
version: "3.7"

services:
  #we'll call our service minio just like the --name argument above
  minio:
    #next we use the latest image:
    image: minio/minio:latest
    #then we specify the command to run inside the container
    command: server /data --address=":9000" --console-address=":9001"
    #next we map a minio_storage volume to /data which is slightly different
    #from the original command above
    volumes:
      - minio_storage:/data
    #last but not least we expose the same ports as above:
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"
      - "9001:9001"

#here we define the minio volume that gets mapped into the container
volumes:
  minio_storage:
```

I decided to use a volume rather than a bind mount in the docker-compose conversion as this is simply a development setup and we don’t care if the volume gets nuked at some point. Docker desktop on Windows with WSL 2 isn’t the best combination. Using a volume is a better choice.

The script used to start the run_postgressql.sh docker container looks like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

SCRIPT_DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" &> /dev/null && pwd )"

docker run -t --rm \
    --name postgres \
    --network fiberplane-api \
    -v "$SCRIPT_DIR/postgresql_storage:/var/lib/postgresql/data" \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=fiberplane \
    -p 5432:5432 \
    postgres:11
```

Using the same approach as above, we can expand the `docker-compose.yml` with the postgres service:

```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:11
    volumes:
      - postgres_storage:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    #docker-compose also allows us to define env vars inside
    #the container environment:
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: fiberplane

  minio:
    image: minio/minio:latest
    command: server /data --address=":9000" --console-address=":9001"
    volumes:
      - minio_storage:/data
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"
      - "9001:9001"

volumes:
  postgres_storage:
  minio_storage:
```

With all of that, our `docker-compose.yml` file is complete so we can save it in the root of our git repo, create a PR and begin using it!

Where my colleagues can continue to use ./scripts/run_all_services.sh to get up and running, I can simply use docker compose up which will start the services and shut them down when I press ctrl+c just like the bash scripts.

As an additional benefit I can use docker compose up -d to run in daemon mode which will run the services in the background so I can reuse my terminal.

If I wish to access the service logs in while they are running the background I can simply issue a docker compose logs --follow command.

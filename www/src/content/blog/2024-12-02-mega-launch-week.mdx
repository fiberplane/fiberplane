Ready for the hottest new ships in your local debugging world from AI workflows that make life easier to HONC inspired builds to ship APIs faster? Let’s get into it.

## Monday, Dec 2nd: static code analysis for auto Hono.js API routes

One of Fiberplane Studio's core features is the ability to leverage AI generated test data for your Hono API. To do this, Studio needs to understand how your routes interact with middleware, validation, and database schemas. With today's new feature ship, we provide better insights from your source code for more relevant testing and ultimately a better API spec without your manual overhead.

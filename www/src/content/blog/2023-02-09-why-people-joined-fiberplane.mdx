Joining a startup or starting any new job is thrilling but it can also be a big adjustment - new people, new routines, and new opportunities. Sometimes it’s difficult to know exactly what you’re diving into and what to expect. Given that work is something we each dedicate a large part of our lives to, starting somewhere new should be done with a large degree of confidence.

To paint a better picture of why people like working at Fiberplane we asked our team what appealed to them about joining us, and what they enjoy about Fiberplane now that they’ve been working here for at least a few months. Who better to hear it from than those who have walked in your footsteps before you?

## Why our colleagues joined Fiberplane

When asking our colleagues what appealed to them about joining Fiberplane, the answers and motivations were diverse:

- The challenge of joining a new company where I would have the opportunity to help shape what it would become.
- Working with Rust and being able to work fully remotely with a team located in Europe
- I totally loved the idea of making use of data to ease troubleshooting. I am a strong believer in the power of data and I felt Fiberplane could help unleash all of that power and make incident troubleshooting, one of the most stressful activities in overall IT easier and intuitive
- I saw this as an opportunity to contribute to an exciting and fast-moving company
- The chief of staff’s approachability & timely, personable and direct communication. The founder’s past success with Wercker
- Working at a startup on a product that is new and refreshing
- Interesting technical challenge, working in Rust
- A collaborative place with no ego

## What our colleagues like about working at Fiberplane now

The list got longer! We bucketed it into a few categories:

### Team & culture

- The excellent colleagues, who are kind, smart and fun. And still plenty of challenges!
- Working with smart motivated people figuring out how to make the best possible product
- The collaborative spirit, the passion for the product and customer happiness
- Collaborating with the team
- Socialization and collaboration in the quarterly team on-sites (as a remote employee I really appreciate those)
- Relaxed atmosphere, friendly people, very focused
- Fiberplane puts its employees in first place. There is a lot of flexibility, which is important these days
- Chill & relaxed working culture without stigma around giving feedback and being honest (not in a rude way ofc!) and being understanding in case of e.g sickness or it being OK if you need to quickly run an errand

### Autonomy

- Freedom to work on projects which are interesting and to also steer which direction I'd like to work on
- The best part about working for Fiberplane is that you can take ownership of your projects and everyone working here is being transparent
- I love the autonomy and the way everyone works towards the common goal with the same passion and dedication

### Diversity, equity & inclusion

- Focused efforts on increasing diversity and improving inclusivity (really love the gender neutral bathrooms at the office)
- The other aspect of working at Fiberplane that I am very impressed about is the constant effort towards diversity and inclusion. Being inclusive as a company is one thing and everyone having that inclusive mindset is another. I must say, I am extremely impressed with the comfort level everyone at Fiberplane has about their diversity and that is possible only because of the environment we have

### Minimal bureaucracy

- Bureaucracy is reduced to a minimum, which saves a lot of headaches :)
- Having local payroll thanks to being employed through [remote.com](http://remote.com/) instead of being a contractor

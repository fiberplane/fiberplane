Building data APIs can be a daunting task, especially when you're just getting started with a new framework. Enter HONC, a stack designed for lightweight data APIs on the edge. HONC stands for Hono, Drizzle ORM, Neon DB, and Cloudflare, and it offers a robust foundation for developing moderately complex backends.

## Why HONC?

Hono is a fast and flexible framework that simplifies API development. It integrates seamlessly with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database management, making it easier to handle migrations and schema definitions. The HONC stack is particularly well-suited for projects that require performance and type safety.

## Getting Started with HONC

To kickstart your project, you can use the `create-honc-app` CLI to set up a new project with a Neon, D1, or Supabase database. Drizzle ORM plays a crucial role in managing database interactions, ensuring that your type definitions are consistent across the stack.

```sh
npm create honc-app@latest
npm i
```

## Defining Your Database Schema

Drizzle ORM allows you to define your database schema in a type-safe manner. Here's an example of how you can define tables and types for a mock-data API:

```typescript
import { integer, sqliteTable, text } from "drizzle-orm/sqlite-core";

const metadata = {
  id: integer({ mode: "number" }).primaryKey(),
};

export const gaggles = sqliteTable("gaggles", {
  ...metadata,
});

export const geese = sqliteTable("geese", {
  ...metadata,
  gaggleId: integer({ mode: "number" }).references(() => gaggles.id),
});
```

## Validating and Handling Requests

Hono's modular routing and middleware support make it easy to define and validate API endpoints. You can use Zod schemas to ensure that incoming requests meet your application's requirements.

```typescript
import { Hono, type Context } from "hono";
import { cors } from "hono/cors";

const app = new Hono();
app.use("*", cors());

app.get("/gaggles/:id", (c: Context) => {
  return c.text("Not yet implemented", 418);
});
```

## Error Handling and Rate Limiting

Error handling is crucial for any API. Hono provides a simple way to define global error handlers, ensuring that your application responds gracefully to unexpected issues.

```typescript
app.onError((error, c) => {
  console.error(error);
  return c.text("Something went wrong!", 500);
});
```

Rate limiting is another important aspect of API security. With Cloudflare's rate limiting bindings, you can easily control access to your API and prevent abuse.

## Conclusion

The HONC stack offers a powerful yet flexible framework for building data APIs. Its type-safe approach and seamless integration with modern tools make it an excellent choice for developers looking to build performant and maintainable applications.

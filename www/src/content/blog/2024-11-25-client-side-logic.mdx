You just built a great app that gets rendered server-side with Hono.
But now you want to add some client-side logic to it - and Hono ships their own
React-like API to do just that!

In this guide we'll be going over on how to add client-side logic to a Hono app
and unlock the full potential of your project.

## Before getting started

We're building an app that uses Hono running in Cloudflare Workers, leveraging
[static asset bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/binding/)
to serve the app, though the same principles apply to any other way of serving
your app.

As Hono is a server-side app by default, we'll need to make a distinction
between server-side and client-side logic and adjust our build step to
facilitate this.\
We'll be using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) with a few plugins to make this
happen.

## Let us build!

First, let's get started with scaffolding a new Hono app:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">
```sh
npm create hono@latest hono-client
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="yarn">
```sh
yarn create hono hono-client
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="pnpm">
```sh
pnpm create hono hono-client
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="bun">
```sh
bunx create-hono hono-client
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Aside>
Make sure to select the `cloudflare-workers` template when prompted.

The `src` directory will contain a single `index.ts` file with a simple Hono
app. We'll be adding a `client` directory with an index and component:

<FileTree>

- src
  - index.ts
  - **client**
    - **index.tsx** logic to mount the app on the client
    - **Counter.tsx** component to demonstrate client-side logic

</FileTree>

We set up a simple counter component that increments a count when a button is
clicked:

```tsx title="src/client/Counter.tsx"
import { useState } from "hono/jsx";

export function Counter() {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

	return (
		<div>
			<button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)} type="button">
				Increase count
			</button>
			<span>Count: {count}</span>
		</div>
	);
}
```

// add client/index.tsx setup

We're going to add some JSX to the `src/index.ts` file, so we first need to
change the file extension to `.tsx`.
Once that's done, we can add Hono's
[JSX renderer middleware](https://hono.dev/docs/middleware/builtin/jsx-renderer)
to the `/` route and return the `<Counter />` component:

```tsx title="src/index.tsx" {2, 4, 8-23, 26}
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { jsxRenderer } from "hono/jsx-renderer";

import { Counter } from "./client/Counter";

const app = new Hono();

app.use(
	"/",
	jsxRenderer(
		({ children }) => (
			<html lang="en">
				<head>
					<meta charSet="utf-8" />
					<meta content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" name="viewport" />
					<title>hono</title>
				</head>
				<body>{children}</body>
			</html>
		),
		{ docType: true },
	),
);

app.get("/", (c) => {
	return c.render(<Counter />);
});

export default app;
```


To run and build the app, we're going to install Vite and two Hono plugins to
facilitate client-side logic:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">
```sh
npm install vite
npm install -D @hono/vite-build @hono/vite-dev-server
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="yarn">
```sh
yarn add vite
yarn add -D @hono/vite-build @hono/vite-dev-server
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="pnpm">
```sh
pnpm add vite
pnpm add -D @hono/vite-build @hono/vite-dev-server
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="bun">
```sh
bun add vite
bun add -D @hono/vite-build @hono/vite-dev-server
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

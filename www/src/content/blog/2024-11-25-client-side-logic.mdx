You just built a great app that gets rendered server-side with Hono.
But now you want to add some client-side logic to it - and Hono ships their own
React-like API to do just that!

In this guide we'll be going over on how to add client-side logic to a Hono app
and unlock the full potential of your project.

## Before getting started

We're building an app that uses Hono running in Cloudflare Workers, leveraging
[static asset bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/binding/)
to serve the app, though the same principles apply to any other way of serving
your app.

As Hono is a server-side app by default, we'll need to make a distinction
between server-side and client-side logic and adjust our build step to
facilitate this.\
We'll be using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) with a few plugins to make this
happen.

## Let's build!

First, let's get started with a new Hono app by running the following command:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">
```sh
npm create hono@latest hono-client
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="yarn">
```sh
yarn create hono hono-client
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="pnpm">
```sh
pnpm create hono hono-client
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="bun">
```sh
bunx create-hono hono-client
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Aside>
Make sure to select the `cloudflare-workers` template when prompted.

The `src` directory will contain a single `index.ts` file with a simple Hono
app. We'll be adding three other files to the `src` directory:

<FileTree>

- src
  - index.ts
  - **api.ts** api routes
  - **web.ts** client routes
  - client
    - **index.tsx** this file will contain the logic to mount the app on the client

</FileTree>

To run and build the app, we're going to install Vite and two Hono plugins to
facilitate client-side logic:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">
```sh
npm install vite
npm install -D @hono/vite-build @hono/vite-dev-server
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="yarn">
```sh
yarn add vite
yarn add -D @hono/vite-build @hono/vite-dev-server
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="pnpm">
```sh
pnpm add vite
pnpm add -D @hono/vite-build @hono/vite-dev-server
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="bun">
```sh
bun add vite
bun add -D @hono/vite-build @hono/vite-dev-server
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

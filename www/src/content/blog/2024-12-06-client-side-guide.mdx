[Hono](https://hono.dev) is a great framework to build serverless apps with
familiar APIs using Web Standards. It comes with a ton of features out of the
box.

One of these features is the ability to compose & render HTML server-side, which
is great for static content.\
But what if you want to add some client-side logic to your app?
You can do so by using the hooks provided by Hono. However, they might not work
in your browser — that's because we're not shipping any JavaScript to the
browser!

<Aside>
  We'll achieve this with client-side hydration. The app gets rendered
  server-side first, and then the client-side script takes over. The [React
  docs](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot#hydrating-server-rendered-html)
  describe it well: > [It] will “attach” your components’ logic to the initial
  generated HTML from > the server. Hydration turns the initial HTML snapshot
  from the server into a > fully interactive app that runs in the browser.
</Aside>

In this guide we'll go over how to build an Hono app with client-side logic,
unlocking the full potential of your projects.

## What are we building?

We're building a simple app that renders a counter component server-side and
hydrates it client-side.\
It runs in Cloudflare Workers, leveraging its
[static asset bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets)
\- though the same principles apply to the other supported environments as well.

Using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) we'll set up two build steps: one for the
client-side logic and one for the server-side logic.

## Let's build!

First, let's get started with scaffolding a new Hono app.

<Tabs syncKey="package-manager">
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm create hono@latest hono-client
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="yarn">

```sh
yarn create hono hono-client
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm create hono hono-client
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="bun">

```sh
bunx create-hono hono-client
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Aside>
  Make sure to select the `cloudflare-workers` template when prompted.
</Aside>

The `src` directory contains a single `index.ts` file with a simple Hono app.
We're adding a `client` directory with an index and component:

<FileTree>

- src
  - index.ts
  - **client**
    - **index.tsx** logic to mount the app on the client
    - **Counter.tsx** component to demonstrate client-side logic

</FileTree>

### Adding the component & mounting point

Let's start by setting up a simple counter component that increments a count
when a button is clicked:

```tsx title="src/client/Counter.tsx"
import { useState } from "hono/jsx";

export function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)} type="button">
        Increase count
      </button>
      <span>Count: {count}</span>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Then we import the component & hydrate it in the client entry file:

```tsx title="src/client/index.tsx"
import { StrictMode } from "hono/jsx";
import { hydrateRoot } from "hono/jsx/dom/client";

import { Counter } from "./Counter";

const root = document.getElementById("root");
if (!root) {
  throw new Error("Root element not found");
}

hydrateRoot(
  root,
  <StrictMode>
    <Counter />
  </StrictMode>
);
```

<Aside>
  We're _hydrating_ the app client-side as opposed to _rendering_ it; the static
  HTML is rendered server-side by Hono. If you're interested in client-side
  rendering only, check out the [example on
  GitHub](https://github.com/oscarvz/cf-workers-hono-client-side).
</Aside>

Your code editor might give you a hint that `document` is not defined. Given we
added the client-side logic, we need to tell TypeScript that we're running in a
browser environment:

```json title="tsconfig.json" ins={6}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    //...
    "lib": ["ESNext", "DOM"]
    // ...
  }
}
```

We're going to add some JSX to the `src/index.ts` file, so we first need to
change the file extension to `.tsx`.
Once that's done, we can add Hono's
[JSX renderer middleware](https://hono.dev/docs/middleware/builtin/jsx-renderer)
to the `/` route and return the statically rendered `<Counter />` component:

```tsx title="src/index.tsx" ins={2, 4, 8-23, 26} del={25}
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { jsxRenderer } from "hono/jsx-renderer";

import { Counter } from "./client/Counter";

const app = new Hono();

app.use(
  jsxRenderer(
    ({ children }) => (
      <html lang="en">
        <head>
          <meta charSet="utf-8" />
          <meta content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" name="viewport" />
          <title>hono-client</title>
        </head>
        <div id="root">{children}</div>
      </html>
    ),
    { docType: true }
  )
);

app.get("/", (c) => {
  return c.text("Hello Hono!");
  return c.render(<Counter />);
});

export default app;
```

We're almost there. If you run the app now with the `dev` script, you'll get an
error. Let's fix that by adding the build steps!

### Adding build steps and scripts

At this point, we have both server-side and client-side logic and need to add
two build steps to our project. Let's install Vite and two plugins to facilitate
this.

<Tabs syncKey="package-manager">
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm install vite
npm install -D @hono/vite-build @hono/vite-dev-server
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="yarn">

```sh
yarn add vite
yarn add -D @hono/vite-build @hono/vite-dev-server
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm add vite
pnpm add -D @hono/vite-build @hono/vite-dev-server
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="bun">

```sh
bun add vite
bun add -D @hono/vite-build @hono/vite-dev-server
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

In the root of your project, create a `vite.config.ts` file. We'll define the
config for both the client-side build and the server-side build:

```ts title="vite.config.ts"
import build from "@hono/vite-build/cloudflare-workers";
import devServer from "@hono/vite-dev-server";
import cloudflareAdapter from "@hono/vite-dev-server/cloudflare";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig(({ mode }) => {
  if (mode === "client") {
    return {
      build: {
        rollupOptions: {
          input: "./src/client/index.tsx",
          output: {
            entryFileNames: "assets/[name].js"
          }
        },
        outDir: "./public"
      }
    };
  }

  const entry = "./src/index.tsx";
  return {
    server: { port: 8787 },
    plugins: [
      devServer({ adapter: cloudflareAdapter, entry }),
      build({ entry })
    ]
  };
});
```

<Aside>
  For the client build, the `outDir` is set to `./public`. This is the directory
  where the Worker will find the client-side script.
</Aside>

Now we need to adjust the `package.json` scripts to facilitate the new build
steps. Additionally, we set the type to `module` to allow for ESM imports:

```json title="package.json" del={5} ins={3, 6, 7}
{
  "name": "hono-client",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "wrangler dev",
    "dev": "vite dev",
    "build": "vite build --mode client && vite build",
    "deploy": "wrangler deploy --minify"
  }
  // ...
}
```

<Aside type="tip">
  This would be a good moment to add the `public` directory to your
  `.gitignore`.
</Aside>

#### Running the app

If you run the app now with the `dev` script, you'll see the counter component
rendered server-side. The client-side script hasn't been loaded yet, so the
counter component won't work.

<Tabs syncKey="package-manager">
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm run dev
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="yarn">

```sh
yarn dev
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm dev
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="bun">

```sh
bun dev
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

  </p>
</video>

There's only one step left to make the counter component work. We're almost
there!

### Load the client-side script

As a final step we need to load the client-side script in the document's head.

For the script that we're loading we need to make a distinction between a
development and production environment. Vite allows us to do this easily with
its [built-in env](https://vite.dev/guide/env-and-mode#env-variables).
For the dev environment we can load the client's `.tsx` file; for production we
have to read it from the `public` directory.

First we add the `vite/client` types to the TypeScript config:

```json title="tsconfig.json" ins={6}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    //...
    "types": [
      // ...
      "vite/client"
    ]
    //...
  }
}
```

Then we adjust the `src/index.tsx` file to load the client-side script,
depending on the environment:

```tsx title="src/index.tsx" ins={11-18}
// ...
app.use(
  jsxRenderer(
    ({ children }) => (
      <html lang="en">
        <head>
          <meta charSet="utf-8" />
          <meta content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" name="viewport" />
          <title>hono-client</title>

          <script
            type="module"
            src={
              import.meta.env.PROD
                ? "/assets/index.js"
                : "/src/client/index.tsx"
            }
          />
        </head>
        <body>
          <div id="root">{children}</div>
        </body>
      </html>
    ),
    { docType: true }
  )
);
// ...
```

#### Run locally

Great! You can now run the app with the `dev` script and see the counter
component in action.

<Tabs syncKey="package-manager">
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm run dev
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="yarn">

```

</TabItem>

```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="bun">

```

</TabItem>

    </a> on GitHub!

  </p>

## Deploying

To deploy the app to Cloudflare Workers we have to update `wrangler.toml` so it
points to the correct worker build & resolves the public assets directory.
Lastly, we update the `deploy` script.

```toml title="wrangler.toml" del={2} ins={3, 5}
name = "hono-client"
main = "src/index.ts"
main = "dist/index.js"

assets = { directory = "./public/" }
# ...
```

```json title="package.json" del={6} ins={7}
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite dev",
    "build": "vite build --mode client && vite build",
    "deploy": "wrangler deploy --minify",
    "deploy": "$npm_execpath run build && wrangler deploy --no-bundle"
  }
  // ...
}
```

<Aside>
  Note that the `wrangler deploy` has the `--no-bundle` flag. The build is taken
  care of by the Vite build step. Wrangler's task is merely to deploy it to the
  Cloudflare Workers platform.
</Aside>

### Deploy your app

You can now deploy your app to Cloudflare Workers with the `deploy` script:

<Tabs syncKey="package-manager">
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm run deploy
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="yarn">

```sh
yarn deploy
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm deploy
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="bun">

```sh
bun deploy
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Conclusion

That's it! You've built a simple Hono app with client-side logic. You can now
extend your app with more complex client-side features, such as fetching data
from an API route, adding a form to your project, or even building a full SPA.

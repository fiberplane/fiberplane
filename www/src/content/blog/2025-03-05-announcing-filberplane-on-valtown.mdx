At Fiberplane, we’re a Typescript (and occasionally Rust) shop and we love [Hono.js](https://hono.dev/) -
so much that we developed our Hono-native API [Playground](https://fiberplane.com/blog/hono-native-playground/) to quickly
explore and test your APIs, powered by OpenAPI. But our love for TypeScript extends beyond just the language itself.
We are all about helping developers rapidly build and deploy TypeScript APIs for high-speed iteration.
That’s why we’re excited to share our new tools available on [Val Town](https://val.town)—a fantastic platform that
allows developers to build APIs directly in their browser without getting bogged down in backend
details from the start.

## Val Town

[Val Town](https://val.town) is a collaborative platform that enables users to write, deploy, and share
JavaScript or TypeScript code snippets, known as “vals,” directly from their browser.
These vals can be utilized to build APIs, schedule functions, send emails, and persist
data without the need to manage infrastructure.

We believe Val.town is an incredible resource for building serverless APIs,
and we’re thrilled to introduce two new experiences for developers looking to build
and test their serverless Hono APIs using browser-based tools. You’ll find [two public starter
Vals](https://www.val.town/u/fiberplane) with all the features of the Fiberplane API Playground; one basic
[Hono starter API](https://www.val.town/v/fiberplane/fiberplaneHonoStarter) and
one Val [project](https://www.val.town/x/fiberplane/fiberplaneHonoZodStarter) featuring an OpenAPI/Zod setup.

## Playground, Zod, and OpenAPI included

Each Fiberplane Val, a hosted TypeScript function, includes a demo application built in Hono to explore.

These examples offer hands-on experiences that let you explore the features of the Fiberplane API Playground,
all integrated within the Val Town platform. Here’s what you can do with these Vals:

- Built-in interactive documentation designed to make exploring APIs a breeze
- Automatic route discovery displayed as human-readable CRUD operations, making it easy to see exactly what each route does and how to interact with it.
- Endpoint testing to generate requests before you deploy, ensuring that everything is functioning as expected
- Authentication made easy to add correct headers to your requests and reuse them for testing other endpoints across your API.

## What’s next

Stay tuned as the team is working on deeper tracing functionality for both the Fiberplane and Val Town
community to leverage in the API Playground, and a [HONC](https://honc.dev) related announcement soon!
Whether you're a seasoned TypeScript developer or just getting started with serverless APIs,
these tools are here to make your life easier.
Happy coding!

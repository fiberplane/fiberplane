Nowadays, building HTTP APIs for external usage without implementing the [OpenAPI spec](https://swagger.io/specification/) is like buying an IKEA shelf without assembly instructions.
OpenAPI serves as a guide to your API and is an open standard that can be interpreted by various tools to display information on how to interact with your application's API.
This makes it easy to generate documentation for your API.

Today, we are excited to announce that Fiberplane has added support for OpenAPI specs generate with [Hono Zod OpenAPI](https://hono.dev/examples/zod-openapi) middleware , providing you with an IKEA catalog for your APIs!

## OpenAPI Support in Fiberplane

With Fiberplane's support for OpenAPI specs, integrating API documentation into Fiberplane Studio provides a central place to test and debug your Hono application APIs.
On one hand, the OpenAPI spec helps design the correct payload.
On the other hand, it helps you verify if the schemas and routes are correctly defined with Zod and fine-tune your application's API spec.

The Fiberplane client library now supports the detection of OpenAPI specs generated with Zod, and Fiberplane Studio displays the corresponding information.

When an OpenAPI definition is detected, a new tab in Studio will show the OpenAPI details.

You can view the expected responses and easily see the required input parameters along with their types, making it simple to craft correct payloads for your application's API.

## Leveraging Hono Zod

If you want to test it out, we have a code example [here](https://github.com/fiberplane/fpx/tree/main/examples/openapi-zod). Itâ€™s a simple user API that allows you to get information about stored users, delete a user, or add a new user to your database.
The application uses Zod to generate the OpenAPI spec.

[Zod](https://zod.dev/?id=introduction) is a TypeScript-first library to define schema declarations . [Zod to OpenAPI](https://github.com/asteasolutions/zod-to-openapi) uses the zod schemas to generate OpenAPI documentation.
For Hono applications, [Zod OpenAPI](https://hono.dev/examples/zod-openapi) is a third-party middleware that extends the Hono class.

```typescript
import { OpenAPIHono } from "@hono/zod-openapi";
const app = new OpenAPIHono<{ Bindings: Bindings }>();
```

The application can then use Zod schemas to define request and response parameters and bodies:

```typescript
import { z } from "@hono/zod-openapi";

// Schema that defines the body of a request to create a new user
const NewUserSchema = z
  .object({
    name: z.string().openapi({
      example: "John Doe",
      description: "The name of the user"
    }),
    age: z.number().openapi({
      example: 42
    })
  })
  .openapi("NewUser");
```

Next, you can leverage Zod to define the routes of your API and use the schemas you've defined:

```typescript
import { createRoute } from "@hono/zod-openapi";

// Define the request/response schema for a route to create a new user
const createUserRoute = createRoute({
  method: "post",
  path: "/users",
  title: "CreateUser",
  description: "Create a new user",
  request: {
    body: {
      content: {
        "application/json": {
          schema: NewUserSchema
        }
      }
    }
  },
  responses: {
    201: {
      content: {
        "application/json": {
          schema: UserSchema
        }
      },
      description: "Newly created user"
    }
  }
});
```

Use the route in your application:

```typescript
app.openapi(createUserRoute, async (c) => {
  //your business logic
});
```

Generate OpenAPI docs from your application by adding:

```typescript
// Mount the api documentation
// The OpenAPI documentation will be available at /doc
app.doc("/doc", {
  openapi: "3.0.0",
  info: {
    version: "1.0.0",
    title: "Simple Hono OpenAPI API"
  }
});
```

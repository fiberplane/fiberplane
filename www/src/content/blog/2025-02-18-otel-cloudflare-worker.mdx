In today's distributed systems landscape, observability is crucial for understanding
and debugging complex applications. Today, I'm excited to share details about
[otel-worker](https://github.com/fiberplane/otel-worker). Think of it as an OpenTelemetry collector,
but without the YAML complexity and heavy infrastructure.

We built otel-worker after encountering some persistent latency with Cloudflare’s D1,
where the real bottleneck was elusive.
We wanted a straightforward, powerful way to capture, store, and analyze our
production traces.

There are existing OpenTelemetry observability solutions including Datadog (if you enjoy throwing money at problems), Baselime, and open source projects, but we decided to roll our own, written in
Rust and specifically geared towards Cloudflare Workers. This has some key benefits:

- Traditional OpenTelemetry collectors require significant infrastructure
- Why process telemetry in `us-east-1` when you can can store them directly at the edge with Cloudflare’s D1 (we know; Cloudflare has not yet implemented read replicas for D1 yet)
- No YAML

We chose Rust as it's a team-favorite tool inside of Fiberplane and we like writing sharp tools
in it, such as our TUI log tailing CLI, [Fogwatch](/blog/fogwatch/).

Alongside Rust, we use the [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) crate for our API. The code is split into
several crates: `otel-worker` and `otel-worker-core`. The `otel-worker-core`
crate contains all the shared code that is used by both the `otel-worker`
crate and our `otel-worker-cli` application. The `otel-worker` crate contains all
the specifics for running our OTLP ingestion code on Cloudflare.
This includes:  the workers-rs code, a Store implementation that targets
Cloudflare's D1 database, and a WebSocket implementation that leverages
[Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/)  for maintaining persistent connections.

The `otel-worker-cli` is our Swiss Army knife for interacting with the
otel-worker system, whether you're developing locally or managing a
production deployment. At its core, it provides a local development server
that mimics the Cloudflare Worker environment, allowing you to test your
OpenTelemetry setup without deploying to the cloud. But where it really shines
is in its comprehensive set of management commands. Need to inspect your traces?
The CLI lets you list all traces or dive deep into specific spans with simple
commands like `cargo cli client traces list` or `cargo cli client spans get <trace-id> <span-id>`.
For cleanup operations, you can delete individual spans or entire traces just as
easily. The CLI also includes handy system management commands for tasks like database
cleanup, and for the debugging enthusiasts, there's a hidden WebSocket monitoring tool
that lets you watch real-time trace updates as they flow through the system.


### Getting started

The `otel-worker` implements the [OTLP/HTTP spec](https://opentelemetry.io/)
and supports both JSON and Protocol Buffers encoding (gRPC is not supported).
It includes HTTP endpoints to retrieve traces and a web-socket endpoint for realtime
notifications about new traces.

#### Authentication

The `otel-worker` uses simple bearer token authentication, which is *required*
for both the OTLP/HTTP endpoints and the traces endpoints.
You'll configure this token using an environment variable during setup.

#### Local Development Setup

To get started with local development, you'll need:

1. Rust installed
2. The Wrangler CLI installed

Once you've cloned the [repository](https://github.com/fiberplane/otel-worker),
create a new D1 database and apply the migrations:

```sh
npx wrangler d1 create fiberplane-otel-db
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply fiberplane-otel-db
```

Then update your `wrangler.toml` to include the database configuration:

```toml
database_name = "fiberplane-otel-db"
# change the databse_id to whatever was output by the wrangler d1 create command
database_id = "id-of-fiberplane-otel-db"
```

Next, set up your authentication token (because security isn't optional) by copying `.dev.vars.example` to `.dev.vars` and setting your desired token:

```sh
AUTH_TOKEN="your-secret-token-here"
```

> **Note**: Compiling the Worker is not supported on Windows at the moment without WSL.

Finally, start the development server:

```sh
npx wrangler dev
```

Your local server will be running at `http://localhost:8787`. Send it some traces:

The worker accepts traces via OTLP/HTTP. The endpoint to send traces to is
`/v1/traces`.

Here's an example of how to send traces to the worker using `curl` from within
the `examples/send-trace` directory inside the repository:

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/v1/traces \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token-here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data-binary @trace.json
```

We can now retrieve the traces from the D1 database as follows:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8787/v1/traces \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token-here"
```

Congratulations! You’ve got a streamlined OpenTelemetry collector up and
running—no need to wrestle with a mile-long YAML file this time.

## Conclusion

We’re well aware that Cloudflare is going to launch an
official OpenTelemetry solution complete with dashboards and alerting.
When that day comes, it’ll likely be a great option for many. Until then,
otel-worker provides a streamlined, cost-effective alternative—letting you
capture and explore your spans without piling on the usual collector overhead.
If you’re looking for an easy, no-fuss way to store and
analyze traces on Cloudflare Workers, we think otel-worker fills that gap nicely.

The source code for otel-worker is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/fiberplane/otel-worker).

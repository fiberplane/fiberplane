As Cloudflare Workers become an increasingly popular choice for edge computing, the need for better observability tools grows with it. Today, I'm excited to introduce Fogwatch, a powerful terminal-based log viewer that brings real-time visibility to your Cloudflare Workers deployments.

## What is Fogwatch?

Fogwatch is an [open-source](https://github.com/fiberplane/fogwatch) terminal-based tool that connects to Cloudflare's API to stream logs from your Workers in real-time. It provides a TUI (Terminal User Interface) for viewing, filtering, and analyzing log data, making it easier to debug and monitor your Workers during development and in production.

## Key Features

Watch your Worker logs as they happen, with zero delay. No more refreshing dashboards or waiting for logs to propagate â€“ see exactly what's happening right now.

Fogwatch features a modern, vim-inspired terminal interface that feels natural to developers. Navigate through logs with familiar keybindings (`j`/`k` for scrolling, `h`/`l` for switching views), and enjoy a distraction-free monitoring experience.

The status code frequency chart at the top of the interface gives you an immediate visual understanding of your Worker's health. Spot patterns and anomalies at a glance.

Quickly focus on what matters with built-in filters:

- Filter by status codes (2xx, 4xx, 5xx)
- Search through logs
- Filter by HTTP methods
- Adjustable sampling rates for high-traffic Workers

Configure Fogwatch your way through:

- Command-line arguments
- Environment variables
- Configuration files (fogwatch.toml)

## Getting Started

Clone and build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fiberplane/fogwatch.git
cd fogwatch
cargo build --release
```

Set your Cloudflare credentials:

```bash
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="your-api-token"
export CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID="your-account-id"
```

And you're ready to start monitoring:

```bash
./target/release/fogwatch #(or just `cargo run` if you're on a dev build)
```

## Why Fogwatch?

While Cloudflare's dashboard provides basic logging capabilities, Fogwatch brings several advantages:

1. **Speed**: Real-time streaming means you see logs instantly
2. **Efficiency**: Terminal-based interface means less resource usage and faster navigation
3. **Developer-First**: Vim-like keybindings and a clean interface make it feel natural for developers

## Under the Hood

Fogwatch is built with Rust, chosen for its performance, reliability, and excellent async runtime support. The application architecture leverages several key components:

### Terminal Interface

The UI is powered by [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui), a Rust library for building rich terminal user interfaces. This gives us:

- Efficient screen updates with double buffering
- Cross-platform terminal manipulation
- Custom widgets for visualizing log data and status code charts

### Real-time Processing

- Async WebSocket connections handle real-time log streaming
- Lock-free data structures ensure smooth UI updates even under heavy log volume
- Event-driven architecture separates UI rendering from log processing

The combination of Rust's zero-cost abstractions and ratatui's efficient rendering ensures Fogwatch stays responsive even when processing thousands of log entries per second.

## What's Next?

The roadmap for Fogwatch includes exciting features like:

- Enhanced filtering with path pattern matching and response time filters
- Expanded analytics with request rate metrics and error tracking
- Quality of life improvements like auto-reconnect and session persistence

## Try It Today

Whether you're debugging a production issue or monitoring your Workers' performance, Fogwatch provides the visibility you need. Give it a try today and experience a better way to monitor your Cloudflare Workers.

One of Fiberplane Studio's core features is the ability to
[generate test data](https://fiberplane.com/docs/features/generating-with-ai/) for your Hono API.
To do this, Studio needs to understand how your routes interact with middleware, validation, and database schemas.

We recently improved how Fiberplane Studio analyzes your source code to provide better insights into these relationships,
and it was no small feat.

We needed to implement a static code analysis tool that could determine:

- All routes in your API
- Any code that might execute for a given route, including its middleware

Even though the current version of Studio is only using this to generate test data,
we're also working on extending this newfound intelligence
to make Studio feel even more like a powerful IDE for testing and debugging Hono APIs.

## Understanding the Goals

Our code analysis serves two primary purposes:

- Discover all routes in a Hono application
- Identify the supporting code (validation, schemas, middleware) associated with each route

The goal is to find all routes in a Hono application,
and then for each route, we'd like to find out which code is actually used to handle a request.
This way, we can provide an LLM with context around what the application accepts/uses (like database schema, zod validation schemas, etc).

The end result is similar to writing a specification for your API, without the immense amount of boilerplate and overhead of doing so from day 1.

## How `@fiberplane/source-analysis` works

All of our code analysis logic is open source and lives in a dedicated npm package:

The first thing we needed to do is to find all routes in a Hono api.
After that, we needed to find out all the code that is associated with each route,
_including its middleware_.

We considered several strategies.
One approach was to specify the main entry of an application, find the Hono app in that file, and go through the source code from there.
The downside to this is that the entry file would need to be specified (or found out by our code base).

An alternative approach, which we went with, is to analyze all source code
and find any variables that are of the `Hono<` generic type.
From there, we can apply some heuristics to determine the entry point/main app.

On a high level what needs to happen is as follows:

1. **Extract routes** — Go through all code and map all apps, routes, middleware and links between apps. Also keep track of what code is related to the app/route/middleware and keep track of what code that code might refer to (etc). This data is stored in the `ResourceManager`.
2. **Analyze routes** — Once all code has been converted into our own data structure, we find the hono apps and see which one has the most routes/entries (and if routes refer to each other their value is added as well). The app with the highest number is treated as the entry point.
3. **Describe routes** — Create an intermediate result, `RoutesResult`, which contains:

   - A reference to a mock Hono app, which can be used to find out what code is executed for a given method/request.
   - `getFilesForHistory()` — a method that can be called to see all code that can be executed for a request to an endpoint.
   - `resetHistory()` — a method to reset the result of the analysis to an initial state.

### Data structures for extracting routes

The `@fiberplane/source-analysis` package uses several key data structures to represent the elements of a Hono project.
Understanding these data structures can be helpful if you want to work in this package.

#### `RouteTree`

The `RouteTree` type represents a reference to an `app` instance created with `new Hono()`.
It contains a list of `entries`, which includes information about any calls to the `app` that add routes (such as `app.get()`, `app.use()`, and `app.route()`).

```typescript
export type RouteTree = {
  id: RouteTreeId;
  type: "ROUTE_TREE";
  entries: RouteTreeEntry[];
  // other properties...
};
```

#### `RouteTreeEntry`

The `RouteTreeEntry` type represents an entry in a route tree. It can be one of the following types:

- `RouteEntry` — This represents a call to `app.get()`
- `RouteTreeReference` — This is the data structure for `app.route()`
- `MiddlewareEntry` — Represents calls to `app.use()`

```typescript
export type RouteTreeEntry = RouteEntry | RouteTreeReference | MiddlewareEntry;
```

#### Other data structures

In order to capture information about other code, the packages uses two other data structures:

- `SourceReference` — Defines a reference to section of code (like a function, a constant, etc). A source reference can refer to one or more other `SourceReference`s as well as one or more `ModuleReference`s.
- `ModuleReference` — Represents a link to another file/external package and should be part of an import statement.

All data structures (apart from `ModuleReference`) can contain references to either modules or source references.

We generate ids for each resource, and then all resources get stored using their id in a `Map` in the `ResourceManager`.

Although `ID`s are basically strings — which always start with the basic type like `ROUTE_TREE`, `SOURCE_REFERENCE`, etc — in Typescript-land they are made specific using [type tagging](https://medium.com/@KevinBGreene/surviving-the-typescript-ecosystem-branding-and-type-tagging-6cf6e516523d) (using type-fest).
This way typescript is aware what kind of a resource is being returned when calling `ResourceManager.getResource`.

## Extracting the code for a route

After creating the resources based on the source code, we determine the main entry endpoint for the API.
That main entry point is then used in the `RoutesResult` to set up a separate, dummy Hono app.

This hono app is never actually listening on a port but is solely used to fire off mock requests.
The reconstructed app could be written out something like this:

```ts
type HistoryId =
  | RouteEntryId
  | RouteTreeId
  | RouteTreeReferenceId
  | MiddlewareEntryId;
const history: Array<HistoryId> = [];

const routingApp = new Hono();
routingApp.use((_, next) => {
  // Append main RouteTreeId to history
  history.push("SOME_ROUTE_TREE_ID");
  return next();
});

routingApp.get("/", (c) => {
  // Append RouteEntryId to history
  history.push("SOME_ROUTE_ENTRY_ID");
  return c.text("Ok");
});

routingApp.get("/profile", () => {
  // Append  RouteEntryId to history
  history.push("SOME_OTHER_ROUTE_ENTRY_ID");
  return c.text("Ok");
});
```

Now, if the mock `routingApp` handles a request, the history array will contain all IDs involved in handling a request for a specific method and path.
Given those IDs, it is possible to generate the code by converting the data structures back into code, and include all things that these structures refer to.

In this way, the end result only includes code that might actually get executed for the request.

## Performance

On smaller projects, the source code analysis is quite fast, it might even take less than 100ms.
However on larger code bases some calls can become a little sluggish.

One expensive function is `getProgram`—it's a method on the [Typescript Language Service](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript/wiki/using-the-language-service-api) that returns a compiler instance.
Even on tiny projects, this call can take ~50ms, so the approach we take is to call `getProgram` as few times as possible and as early as possible.

Another potential issue is that what's included in `tsconfig.json` can have quite a significant performance impact,
especially specifying types using the `compilerOptions.types` option.
For example, adding `node` types for the simplest project in the test suite added 5ms to the test (bumping it to around 50ms).

This brings us to another optimization that was done for larger projects:
caching results for `readFile`, `fileExists` and `directoryExists`.
These calls happen a lot, while typescript is trying to figure out for instance whether a package exists and where it is located.

So in case of Fiberplane's source-analysis package, we cache the results of these calls when parsing the source code,
and we bust the cache when files change on the filesystem.

## The future

It would be _really_ nice if we could perform incremental analysis.
Now, the second time a code base is analyzed, it is typically a bit faster,
but we could improve the package by only analyzing files that are related to the what has been changed since the last time the analysis completed.

Even further in the future it could be interesting to use a language that's more performant like Rust that can parse typescript.

## Debug your Hono APIs

Fiberplane Studio is a local debugging companion designed to help you to build, test, and develop [Hono](https://hono.dev) APIs.
It is open source and available to try now! Check out [the getting started guide here](https://fiberplane.com/docs/get-started/).

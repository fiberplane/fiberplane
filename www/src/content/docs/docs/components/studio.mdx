Fiberplane Studio is the frontend component that allows you to explore your Hono API during development. It runs locally on your machine and serves as a companion for debugging and testing your Hono app.

## Setup

The easiest way to run Fiberplane Studio is via `npx`. Simply run the command from the root of your project:

<PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="@fiberplane/studio" />

This will take you through a few configuration steps, and then spins up the Studio. Your configuration is saved in a `.fpxconfig` folder, in the root of your project.
The contents of this folder are ignored by git by default.

## Settings

Within the Studio, you can enable various settings. In the following Features sections, you'll learn how to leverage these settings for debugging and testing your application.

### Request autofill

When enabled in the Studio, this feature allows you to generate sample request data using AI. To use this feature, you must provide a valid API key for either OpenAI or Anthropic.

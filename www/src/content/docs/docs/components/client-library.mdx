description: An OpenTelemetry client library for Hono that integrates with Fiberplane Studio
---

import { Aside, LinkCard } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import PackageManagers from "@/components/PackageManagers.astro";

The Fiberplane Studio client library integrates with the [Hono](https://hono.dev/) web framework to send [OpenTelemetry traces](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces/) to Fiberplane Studio, and give you rich application context while you're developing.

## Installation

The install process is nothing novel. To install the client library in your Hono project by running the following command:

<PackageManagers pkg="@fiberplane/hono-otel" />

<Aside type="caution">
  Fiberplane Studio and client library currently only support Hono running on
  Cloudflare Workers runtime. If you are using Node.js, Deno, or Bun, you can
  still use Fiberplane Studio, but you will not get the same features as the
  client library. You can upvote any of the [respective issues
  here](https://github.com/fiberplane/fpx/issues/192) to help us prioritize the
  development.

## Usage within Hono

Below is an example of how to integrate the client library in a Hono app:

```ts ins={2,8} title="index.ts"
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { instrument } from "@fiberplane/hono-otel";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/", (c) => c.text("Hello, Hono!"));

export default instrument(app);
```

### Advanced usage: Custom spans

The `measure` function from the client library allows you to create custom spans for any function within your application, enabling more granular tracing.

```ts ins={6-10} title="index.ts"
import { instrument, measure } from "@fiberplane/hono-otel";

const app = new Hono();

// Create a loop function that will get recorded as a span inside the trace for a incoming given request
const loop = measure("loop", (n: number) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    console.log(`Loop iteration: ${i}`);
  }
});

app.get("/", (c) => {
  loop(100);
  return c.text("Hello, Hono!");
});

export default instrument(app);
```

## Configuration

By default, the client library does not send traces. To start sending data to Fiberplane Studio, you need to set the `FPX_ENDPOINT` environment variable.

When starting Fiberplane Studio via the command line with `npx @fiberplane/studio`, the `FPX_ENDPOINT` is automatically set to Fiberplane Studio's default ingestion endpoint: `http://localhost:8788/v1/traces`.

If you are using Cloudflare workers, ensure that Node.js compatibility mode must be enabled in your `wrangler.toml` file:

```toml title="wrangler.toml"
# ...
compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_compat" ]
```

By default, the Fiberplane Studio CLI setup will enable Node.js compatibility mode for Cloudflare Workers.

### Customizing the client library behavior

The client library allows you to override the default behavior of the `instrument` function.

By default, `instrument` will change the behavior of `fetch` and `console.*` methods, in order to produce telemetry data for all `fetch` requests and logging events.

You can disable these features by setting the following configuration parameters to `false`:

```js ins={9-14} title="index.ts"
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { instrument } from "@fiberplane/hono-otel";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/", (c) => c.text("Hello, Hono!"));

export default instrument(app, {
  monitor: {
    // Don't create traces for fetch requests
    fetch: false,
    // Don't proxy `console.*` functions to send logging data to a local FPX server
    logging: false
  }
});
```

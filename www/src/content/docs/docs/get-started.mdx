Fiberplane Studio is a local debugging companion designed to help you to build, test, and develop [Hono](https://www.hono.dev) APIs.


<Steps>
1. ### Set up a Hono project

    You can set up a basic Hono project via your terminal:

    <PackageManagers type="create" pkg="hono@latest" args="my-app" />

    If you want a project that includes an ORM, a database, and is ready to deploy, we recommend using [HONC ðŸª¿](https://honc.dev/):

    <PackageManagers type="create" pkg="honc@latest" />

2. ### Add the Fiberplane Studio client

    Install the Studio client library in your Hono project. The client library will report traces to the local Fiberplane Studio and give you rich application context while you're developing.

    <PackageManagers pkg="@fiberplane/hono-otel" />

    Add the client library to `index.ts`

    ```typescript title="index.ts"
    import { Hono } from "hono";
    import { instrument } from "@fiberplane/hono-otel";

    const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: Bindings }>();

    app.get("/", (c) => {
      return c.text("Hello Hono!");
    });

    export default instrument(app);
    ```


    <Aside type="caution">
    Fiberplane Studio and client library currently only support Hono running on Cloudflare Workers runtime. If you are using Node.js, Deno, or Bun, you can still use Fiberplane Studio, but you will not get the same features as the client library. You can upvote any of the [respective issues here](https://github.com/fiberplane/fpx/issues/192) to help us prioritize the development.
    </Aside>

3. ### Launch Fiberplane Studio
    In a new terminal window start Fiberplane Studio from your project directory:

    <PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="@fiberplane/studio" />

    Finally, start (or restart) your application, and you're ready to go!

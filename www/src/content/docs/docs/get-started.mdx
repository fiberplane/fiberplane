FPX is a local debugging companion designed to help you to build, test, and develop [Hono](https://www.hono.dev) APIs.

<Steps>

	1. ### Set up a Hono project

		You can set up a basic Hono project via your terminal:

		<PackageManagers type="create" pkg="hono@latest" args="my-app" />

		If you want a project including an ORM, a database and already has a cloud deployment platform in mind we recommend using [HONC](https://honc.dev/):

		<PackageManagers type="create" pkg="honc@latest" />

	2. ### Add FPX middleware

		Install the fpx middleware

		<PackageManagers pkg="@fiberplane/hono-otel" />

		Add the fpx middleware to the `index.ts` of your Hono project

		```typescript title="index.ts"
		import { Hono } from "hono";
		import { instrument } from "@fiberplane/hono-otel";

		const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: Bindings }>();

		app.get("/", (c) => {
		  return c.text("Hello Hono!");
		});

		export default instrument(app);
		```

		start your application

	3. ### Launch FPX

		in a new terminal next to your application start fpx:

		<PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="@fiberplane/studio" />

</Steps>

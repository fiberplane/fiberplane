Fiberplane Studio is a local debugging companion designed to help you to build, test, and develop [Hono](https://www.hono.dev) APIs.

<Steps>
1. ### Set up a Hono project
    You can set up a basic Hono project via your terminal:

    <PackageManagers type="create" pkg="hono@latest" args="my-app" />

    If you want a project that includes an ORM, a database, and is ready to deploy, we recommend using [HONC](https://honc.dev/):

    <PackageManagers type="create" pkg="honc@latest" />

2. ### Add the Fiberplane Studio client
    Install the Studio client library in your Hono project

    <PackageManagers pkg="@fiberplane/hono-otel" />

    Add the client library to `index.ts`

    ```typescript title="index.ts"
    import { Hono } from "hono";
    import { instrument } from "@fiberplane/hono-otel";

    const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: Bindings }>();

    app.get("/", (c) => {
      return c.text("Hello Hono!");
    });

    export default instrument(app);
    ```

3. ### Launch Fiberplane Studio
    In a new terminal window, and from your project directory, start Fiberplane Studio:

    <PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="@fiberplane/studio" />

    Finally, start (or restart) your application, and you're ready to go!

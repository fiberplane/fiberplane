Fiberplane Studio is a local debugging companion designed to help you to build, test, and develop [Hono](https://hono.dev) APIs.

<Steps>
1. ### Set up a Hono project

    You can set up a basic Hono project via your terminal:

    <PackageManagers type="create" pkg="hono@latest" args="my-app" />

    If you want a project that includes an ORM, a database, and is ready to deploy, we recommend using [HONC ðŸª¿](https://honc.dev/):

    <PackageManagers type="create" pkg="honc@latest" />

2.  ### Add the Fiberplane Studio client

    Install the Studio client library in your Hono project. The client library will report traces to the local Fiberplane Studio and give you rich application context while you're developing.

    <PackageManagers pkg="@fiberplane/hono-otel" />

    Add the client library to `index.ts`

    <Platforms
      platforms={["cf-worker", "node"]}
      title="index.ts"
      code={[getStartedHonoRawCode, getStartedNodeRawCode]}
    />

    <Aside type="caution">
      Fiberplane Studio and the client library only support Hono on Cloudflare
      Workers and Node.js. You can upvote support for Bun and Deno on [their
      respective issues here](https://github.com/fiberplane/fpx/issues/192) to
      help us prioritize development.
    </Aside>

3.  ### Launch Fiberplane Studio

        In a new terminal window start Fiberplane Studio from your project directory:

        <PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="@fiberplane/studio" />

        Finally, start (or restart) your application, and you're ready to go!

import { FileTree, Aside, Steps, Card, LinkCard } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import Button from "@/components/Button.astro";

This is a little cheatsheet for using Starlight for documenting Fiberplane features on our website.


### Adding a new page

<Aside type="tip">

See if it fits under any existing docs pages - long docs pages are **good**. They are <kbd>cmd</kbd> / <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>f</kbd>-able and allow the reader to find all info they need under one page.

</Aside>

To add another page, create a new file in the `src/content/docs/docs` folder.

<FileTree>
- astro.config.mjs
- package.json
- README.md
- ...
- public/  (e.g: file assets, plain text - not images!)
- src/
	- assets/ images that need to be optimized by Astro
	- components/ our custom reusable components
	- pages/
	- content/
		- landing/
		- blog/
		- docs/
			- docs/
				- get-started.mdx
				- components/
					- client-library.mdx
				- features/
					- making-requests.mdx
					- generating-with-ai.mdx
					- **new-page.mdx**
					- ...
</FileTree>

The Sidebar will be populated automatically. If not you can configure it in the `astro.config.mjs` file.

### How docs are organized

- Get started: just the quick start for now
- Components: an overview of each of the components
- Features: how to use main features of Fiberplane Studio (user flows)

### Frontmatter

Every document has a frontmatter section at the top that describes the most important elements. Some fields are mandatory and the site won't build if they are missing.

```md
---
title: Using Starlight # (required)
description: A short description of the page # page will build without this but you should include it
sidebar: # all optional but you might want to configure it sometimes
  hidden: false # (optional) default is false you can hide it if you want
  order: 5  # the order of the sidebar items (alphabetical otherwise
  label: Getting started with Starlight # default is the title but you can change it

---


# My heading <!-- don't use h1s -->

My documentation page content

```

See full [frontmatter reference](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/frontmatter) for more information.

## Components

Starlight has a lot of components to organize your information. You can find the complete reference of what's builtin [here](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/components).

Builtin components can be imported from `@astrojs/starlight/components` and our custom ones from `@/components/*` directly in the same MDX file.

```mdx
import { Aside, Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Button } from "@/components/Button.astro";
```

We'll highlight a few with some best practices.

### Using code components

Code components don't need to be imported, they can be added using the classic markdown syntax.

Provide as much context as possible:

- what is the environment? File or a shell? What is the file path?
- use appropriate syntax highlighting
- show the action using a diff or annotation

**This is good:**

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { instrument } from "@fiberplane/hono-otel";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/", (c) => {
  return c.text("Hello, world!");
});

app.get("/another-route", (c) => {
  return c.text("Another route!");
});

export default instrument(app);
```

**This is better:**

```ts title="src/index.ts" ins={"Import the instrument function":2-3} ins={11-13} ins={"Wrapping the app with instrument":15-16}
import { Hono } from "hono";

import { instrument } from "@fiberplane/hono-otel";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/", (c) => {
  return c.text("Hello, world!");
});

app.get("/another-route", (c) => {
  return c.text("Another route!");
});


export default instrument(app);
```

Full reference of the Expressive Code component can be found [here](https://expressive-code.com/key-features/syntax-highlighting/)

### Steps

Anytime you have multistep instructions, use the `<Steps>` component to render them as opposed to adding a list number in a heading.


<Steps>
1. Step 1

	nested things here
2. Step 2

	```sh
	rm -rf /
	```
3. #### Step 3 (can also be a heading)

</Steps>

### Aside

Use the `<Aside>` component to give tips or warnings about something.

<Aside type="caution">
  <p>This is a caution!</p>
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
  <p>This is a tip!</p>
</Aside>

<Aside type="danger">
  <p>Don't do this!</p>
</Aside>

### Buttons and keyboard shortcuts

Instead of saying 'press the "Send" button' on the screen you can use the `<Button>` component to render a button with a nicer styling that resembles the buttons on the UI.

Press the <Button>Send</Button> button to send the request

```md
Press <Button>Send</Button> to send the request.
```

You can also use the HTML-native `<kbd>` component to render a keyboard shortcut.

Hit <kbd>cmd</kbd><kbd>enter</kbd> to send the request

```md
Hit <kbd>cmd</kbd><kbd>enter</kbd> to send the request.
```

Feel free to tweak the `Button.astro` component and color vars in the css files to match your needs.

### Adding images

<Aside type="caution" title="Avoid product screenshots when you can">
  **Product** screenshots are great for demonstrating features, but they can become outdated quickly. Use screenshots sparingly.
</Aside>

To add an image to a page, first put it in the `src/assets` folder.

Then you can use standard markdown to add it to the page:

```mdx title="src/my-new-docs-page.md"
![alt text](@/assets/name-of-image.png)
```

You can also use the Astro Image component:

```mdx title="src/my-new-docs-page.mdx"
import { Image } from "astro:assets";
import fpxGenAiGenerateBody from "@/assets/gen-ai-requests--generate.gif"

<Image src={fpxGenAiGenerateBody} alt="Generate a request body with AI" />
```

***

If you're on a `mac` (_shoutout Tim üçé_), use [CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com/) to take screenshots.

If you don't feel like dealing with that, ask Brett, Lau, or Mies to take the screenshots for you.

A few things to keep in mind:

- Show as much of the UI as possible, don't zoom in on a specific part
- Use opacity to highlight or call out certain elements

<Aside type="tip" title="GIFs are large">
  You can record gifs, but even when Astro optimizes them, they are still large files that a long time to load on the website.
</Aside>

We still haven't defined specific, consistent styles for images in our docs, so for now, use your best judgement on making screenshots look good.

## Workflow

Add documentation in the same branch as you're adding the feature.
You can comment out your pages if you don't want them to appear,
or use the `draft: true` frontmatter flag (like on this page) to hide it from the website in production.

<Card title="Website is published when we merge to main">
  The website is deployed automatically when changes are merged into `main`.
  Shoutout Lau. Shoutout GitHub Actions. Shoutout bash scripts.
</Card>

### Best practices

- Keep headings short and descriptive. They will appear automatically in the sidebar.
- See if you can append to a page as opposed to creating a new one. Long pages are good.
- Always mention Geese ü™ø

### Writing guidance

Here are some materials from a technical writing course (shoutout Nele) we went through while back, for recap:

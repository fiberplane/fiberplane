import { FileTree, Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

This is a little cheatsheet for using Starlight for documenting Fiberplane features on our website.


### Adding a new page

<Aside type="tip">

See if it fits under any existing docs pages - long docs pages are **good**. They are <kbd>cmd</kbd> / <kbd>ctrl</kbd> <kbd>f</kbd> and allow the reader to find all info they need under one page.

</Aside>

To add another page, create a new file in the `src/content/docs/docs` folder.

<FileTree>
- astro.config.mjs
- package.json
- README.md
- ...
- public/  (e.g: file assets, plain text - not images!)
- src/
	- assets/ images that need to be optimized by Astro
	- components/ our custom reusable components
	- pages/
	- content/
		- landing/
		- blog/
		- docs/
			- docs/
				- get-started.mdx
				- components/
					- client-library.mdx
				- features/
					- making-requests.mdx
					- generating-with-ai.mdx
					- **new-page.mdx**
					- ...
</FileTree>

The Sidebar will be populated automatically. If not you can configure it in the `astro.config.mjs` file.

### How docs are organized

- Get started: just the quick start for now
- Components: an overview of each of the components
- Features: how to use main features of Fiberplane Studio (user flows)

### Frontmatter

Every document has a frontmatter section at the top that describes the most important elements. Some fields are mandatory and the site won't build if they are missing.

```md
---
title: Using Starlight # (required)
description: A short description of the page # page will build without this but you should include it
sidebar: # all optional but you might want to configure it sometimes
  hidden: false # (optional) default is false you can hide it if you want
  order: 5  # the order of the sidebar items (alphabetical otherwise
  label: Getting started with Starlight # default is the title but you can change it

# My heading <!-- don't use h1s -->

```

See full [frontmatter reference](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/frontmatter) for more information.

## Components

Starlight has a lot of components to organize your information. You can find the complete reference of what's builtin [here](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/components).

Builtin components can be imported from `@astrojs/starlight/components` and our custom ones from `@/components/*` directly in the same MDX file.

```mdx
import { Aside, Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Button } from "@/components/Button.astro";
```

We'll highlight a few with some best practices.

### Using code components

Code components don't need to be imported, they can be added using the classic markdown syntax.

Provide as much context as possible:

- what is the environment? File or a shell? What is the file path?
- use appropriate syntax highlighting
- show the action using a diff or annotation

**This is good:**

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { instrument } from "@fiberplane/hono-otel";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/", (c) => {
  return c.text("Hello, world!");
});

app.get("/another-route", (c) => {
  return c.text("Another route!");
});

export default instrument(app);
```

**This is better:**

```ts title="src/index.ts" ins={"Import the instrument function":2-3} ins={"Add another route":10-13} ins={"Wrapping the app with instrument":15-16}
import { Hono } from "hono";

import { instrument } from "@fiberplane/hono-otel";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/", (c) => {
  return c.text("Hello, world!");
});

app.get("/another-route", (c) => {
  return c.text("Another route!");
});


export default instrument(app);
```

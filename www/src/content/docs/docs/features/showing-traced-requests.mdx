Studio comes with a companion client library `@fiberplane/hono-otel` that if used together, can show you not just the response a typical HTTP client would see, but the entire request-to-response cycle traced.

See the [Client Library docs](/docs/components/client-library) for more information on the client library.

### Navigating to the request trace page

Too see requests that have been traced, you can navigate to the "Requests" tab in the Studio UI. This will show you a list of all the requests that have been made to your API. Select the request you want to see the trace for.

Alternatively, when you [make a request](/docs/features/making-requests), you can click "Go to Trace Details" to see the trace for that request.

You can jump up or down the request overview using the caret buttons at the top right of the page or simply pressing keys <KeyboardButton>j</KeyboardButton> and <KeyboardButton>k</KeyboardButton>.

Hit <KeyboardButton>esc</KeyboardButton> to close the trace details view.

## Summary

At the top of the page, you will see a summary of the trace. It will show either the body of the response if it has been successfully returned, or a list of errors that occurred during the request.

## Timeline

The request timeline shows a topographic view of the request and gives you visual sense of how long each of the steps took to complete. The entire cycle of the request is shown at the top, and any actions, cascading requests, or other events that occur during the request are shown nested underneath. You can click on any of these events to see more details about the event on the right side.

## Details

The details panel shows all of the most important information of the request-response cycle from when the request is received (including its headers, query parameters, and body) to when the response is sent back to the client. Any outgoing requests made by the API in the process of this request-response cycle are also shown here, as well as any errors or simply log messages that occur during the request.

Details view will render the output in best effort mode. By default, the output is rendered as plain text. If the output is a JSON object, it will be rendered in a foldable tree JSON view. For some vendors, like Neon, we are able to extract and display the final SQL query that gets run on the database.

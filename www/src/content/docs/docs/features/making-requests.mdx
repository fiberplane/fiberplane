Requests. Everybody loves a good HTTP request. Right? Don't they? Surely they do.

Fiberplane Studio makes it easy to fire off requests against your API.

Once you're up and running locally, the first page you see in Studio leaves you a single click away from making your first request.

<Image src={FirstRequest} alt="First request" />

"What just happened there?" You might be asking yourself.

When using Fiberplane Studio with the [Hono client library](/docs/components/client-library/), Studio automatically detects the routes in your Hono API and displays them in the sidebar.

In this case, the first route, `GET /`, is selected by default, and by clicking "Send", we make a request to our API and see the response in the panel below.
(Not shown: If there were any logs along the way, we can see them in the "Debug" section.)

We can repeat this process for any of the routes in our API, adding whatever query parameters, headers or body payloads we need.

## Body Payloads (Text, JSON, FormData)

Body payloads are JSON by default. As much as we love JSON, sometimes you do need to send a blob or submit a form. Fair enough.

To modify the body payload, click the "Body" tab and select the type you want to use.

This will, in certain cases, change the `Content-Type` header to match the type of the body you're sending.

If you attach a file to a form, the file will be sent as a multipart/form-data request.

If you just want to send a file, you can attach it directly to the request.

## Request History

In the routes sidebar, there's a collapsed section called "History". This is where you can see all the requests you've made to your API.

If you click on a request in the history, you'll see the details of the request and response appear in the main panels.

If you want to re-run a request, you can click the "Send" button again.

## Custom routes (e.g., OpenAPI)

What if you want to make a request to an API route that isn't detected via the Client Library? Or perhaps to a staging service? We got you covered.

In the routes panel, click the "+" button and select "Custom Route". Add the url and method you want to use, and click "Save".

> **TODO** Add screenshot of the custom route modal

If you have an OpenAPI spec handy, you can also import it and all your routes will be automatically added to the sidebar.

<Aside>
OpenAPI support is a little limited right now, so you might need to manually add your base url in some cases.

## Copy as cURL

> **TODO** Add screenshot of the copy as cURL button

## Websockets (Coming soon!)

The current version of Fiberplane Studio does not support opening a websocket connection and sending messages. We're working on it!

If you want to see this, be sure to chime in on GitHub.

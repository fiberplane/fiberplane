Fiberplane Playground provides an interactive interface for exploring and testing your Hono API. This guide covers the main features of the Playground UI and how to use them effectively.

## API Documentation Browser

The Playground generates interactive documentation from your OpenAPI specification. You can:

- Browse all available endpoints, grouped by their tags
- View detailed request and response schemas
- Test example payloads based on your schema definitions
- Explore authentication requirements for each endpoint

## Making API Requests

The Playground provides a user-friendly interface for constructing API requests:

1. **Select an Endpoint**: Choose the endpoint you want to test from the sidebar
2. **Configure Request Parameters**:
   - Path parameters
   - Query parameters
   - Request body (automatically populated with example data from your schema)

### Example Data

The Playground automatically generates example data based on your OpenAPI schemas. For instance, using the user creation example:

```json
{
  "name": "Matthew",
  "email": "matthew@cloudflare.com"
}
```

You can:

- Use the provided example data as is
- Modify the data to test different scenarios
- View the expected response format

### Response Viewer

After making a request, you can:

- View the response status code
- Inspect response headers
- See the formatted response body
- View response timing information

## Authentication

The Playground supports authentication:

### Setting Authentication Headers

1. Click the "Auth" button in the top navigation
2. Choose your authentication method:
   - Bearer Token
   - None

<Aside type="tip">
  Authentication settings persist across requests, so you only need to set them
  once per session.
</Aside>

### Custom Headers

You can also add any custom headers required by your API:

1. Click "Header" in the top navigation
2. Enter the header name and value
3. Headers will be included in all subsequent requests

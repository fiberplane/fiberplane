The [client library](https://github.com/fiberplane/fpx/tree/main/packages/client-library-otel) leverages [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) to instrument applications and send [traces](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces/) to Fiberplane Studio. It requires the use of [Hono](https://hono.dev/) web application framework.

## Installation 
To install the client library for your Hono application, run the following command in your project directory:
```
npm i @fiberplane/hono-otel@beta 
``` 

## Usage within the Hono application
Below is an example of how to use the client library within a Hono application:
```js {2,8}
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { instrument } from "@fiberplane/hono-otel";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/", (c) => c.text("Hello, Hono!"));

export default instrument(app);
```

### Advanced usage: Custom spans
The `measure` function from the client library allows you to create custom spans for any function within your application, enabling more granular tracing.

```js {6}
import { instrument, measure } from "@fiberplane/hono-otel";

const app = new Hono();

// Create a loop function that will get recorded as a span inside the trace for a incoming given request
const loop = measure("loop", (n: number) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    console.log(`Loop iteration: ${i}`);
  }
});

app.get("/", (c) => {
  loop(100);
  return c.text("Hello, Hono!");
});

export default instrument(app);
```

## Configuration
By default, the client library does not send traces. To define an endpoint, you need to set the `FPX_ENDPOINT` environment variable.

When starting Fiberplane Studio via the command line with `npx @fiberplane/studio`, the `FPX_ENDPOINT` is automatically set to the Fiberplane Studio's default port 8788: `http://localhost:8788/v1/traces`. Additionally, the Fiberplane Studio CLI setup enables Node.js compatibility mode for Cloudflare Workers.

If you are not using Fiberplane Studio and use Cloudflare workers, ensure that Node.js compatibility mode is enabled in the `wrangler.toml` file:
```
compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_compat" ]
``` 
### Customizing the `instrument` function behavior
The client library allows you to override the default behavior of the `instrument` function. By default, the function creates traces for all fetched requests in the application and sends logging data to a locally running FPX Studio. You can disable these features by setting the corresponding monitoring variables to `false`. 

```js {9-14}
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { instrument } from "@fiberplane/hono-otel";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/", (c) => c.text("Hello, Hono!"));

export default instrument(app, {
  monitor: {
    // Don't create traces for fetch requests
    fetch: false,
    // Don't proxy `console.*` functions to send logging data to a local FPX server
    logging: false,
  },
});
```

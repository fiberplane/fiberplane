Fiberplane Studio is the frontend component that allows you to explore your Hono API during development. It runs locally on your machine and serves as a companion for debugging

## CLI setup 
The easiest way to run Fiberplane Studio is through a CLI command. Simply run the command from the root of your project:

```
npx @fiberplane/studio
```

This will spin up the studio on the default port 8788. In the background, it also sets the FPX_ENDPOINT to your application and adds the Node.js compatibility flag in the wrangler.toml file."

## Studio Settings

Within the Frontend, you can enable various settings. In the following Features sections, you'll learn how to leverage these settings for debugging and testing your application.

### Request Autofill
When enabled in the Studio, this feature allows you to generate sample request data using AI. To use this feature, you must provide a valid API key for either OpenAI or Anthropic.

### Custom routes
When enabled, this feature allows you to define and send custom HTTP requests that are not detected by the Hono Otel middleware.

### Proxy Requests
When enabled, this feature allows you to use a public URL to proxy requests towards your application.

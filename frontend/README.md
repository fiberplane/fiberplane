## Development

Easy as pie! Yum.

```sh
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

The original readme that comes with a new vite project is here: [README-VITE.md](./README-VITE.md)

### Stack

- Vite
- React (duh)
- shadcn/ui
- tailwind.css
- clsx (like `classnames`) to manage complexity of adding bunches of classNames
- tanstack react-table
